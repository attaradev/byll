# BYLL

## Background

Byll is an `Aplication Programming Interface (API)` of a sample billing system for a law firm in Ghana. To be as efficient as possible, the firm uses a
billable rate system. This means every lawyer, depending on their grade has a billable rate and
for any project they work on, must send in the total number of hours theyâ€™ve worked on so that
the finance team can create invoices for clients to pay.

The lawyers send their timetable with the following information:

- Employee ID
- Billable Rate (per hour)
- Company
- Date
- Start Time
- End Time

The finance team members can then create an invoice from the created timesheets for a particular company/client using the company name.
